# Contributing to LangChain Voice Agent

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the LangChain Voice Agent project! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- A Google API key for testing
- Basic understanding of LangChain and LangGraph

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aijurist/Agent-for-Call-Analysis.git
   cd Agent-for-Call-Analysis
   ```

3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/aijurist/Agent-for-Call-Analysis.git
   ```

4. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Set up your `.env` file with test credentials

## üîÄ Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add comments where necessary
- Update documentation if needed
- Add tests for new functionality

### 3. Test Your Changes

Run the test suite to ensure everything works:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest test/

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest test/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test
python -m pytest test/test_emotion.py -v
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
```

**Good commit messages:**
- `Add audio streaming support for real-time analysis`
- `Fix emotion intensity calculation bug`
- `Update README with installation instructions`
- `Refactor context management for better performance`

**Bad commit messages:**
- `Update`
- `Fix bug`
- `Changes`

### 5. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select your branch
4. Fill out the PR template with:
   - Description of changes
   - Related issues (if any)
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots (if applicable)

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints where appropriate

Example:
```python
def analyze_emotion(message: str, confidence_threshold: float = 0.7) -> EmotionAnalysisOutput:
    """
    Analyze the emotional content of a message.
    
    Args:
        message: The text message to analyze
        confidence_threshold: Minimum confidence score (0-1)
        
    Returns:
        EmotionAnalysisOutput containing analysis results
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all classes and functions
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document any breaking changes

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names

Example:
```python
def test_emotion_analysis_with_high_intensity_panic():
    """Test that panic emotion is correctly identified with high intensity."""
    # Test implementation
    pass
```
